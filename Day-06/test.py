#operators
#Arithmatic operator
#1.Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
#2.Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
#3.Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
#4.Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand (results in a floating-point number).
#5.Floor Division (//): Divides the left operand by the right operand and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
#6.Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
#7.Exponentiation ():** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.

a = 6
b = 3
addition = a+b
print(addition)  #output = 9

sub = a-b
print(sub) #output = 3

mul = a*b
print(mul) #output = 18

div = a/b 
print(div) #output = 2.0

floordiv = a//b
print(floordiv)  #output = 2

modulus = a%b
print(modulus) #output = 0

exponent = a**b
print(exponent) #output(6*6*6) = 216

#Assignment Operator
#1.Basic Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.
#2.Addition Assignment (+=): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#3.Subtraction Assignment (-=): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#4.Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#5.Division Assignment (/=): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#6.Floor Division Assignment (//=): Performs floor division on the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#7.Modulus Assignment (%=): Calculates the modulus of the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#8.Exponentiation Assignment (=):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

#Basic assignment x =5
#addition assignment
y = 10
y += 2 #equivalent to y = y+2
print(y) #output = 12
